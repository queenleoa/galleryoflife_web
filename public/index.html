        <p><strong>Memory is the final luxury.</strong></p>
        <p>Every act of oppression in history—colonial, caste, state, patriarchal—began by burning stories, erasing records, and un‑naming the makers. When narrative dies, dehumanisation thrives. At its most fundamental level, it is the suppression of stories that has enabled and legitimized the oppression of marginalised communities.</p>
        <p>For centuries, only the rich and powerful were granted the privilege of having their stories live on, while entire communities had their histories erased.</p>
        <p>Colonial powers looted ancient manuscripts and destroyed revolutionary texts. Legacies of ethnic minorities, women, and queer artists vanished as their art was confiscated or ostracized. Indigenous oral histories were dismissed as myth, while sacred artefacts were stolen and displayed as curiosities in distant museums.</p>
        <p>For the first time, the emergence of <strong>web3 technology</strong>—with its decentralized storage and transparent blockchain ledgers—offers a radical shift. It democratizes permanence and proof of authenticity.</p>
        <p>Any creator, not just a blue‑chip painter or the aristocrat, can anchor their work in time. Proof of authenticity is no longer a privilege reserved for oil on canvas or the elite; it belongs to every medium of expression: the defiant verses of a dissident poet, the unflinching lens of a war photographer, the dancer who turns her mourning into movement, the weaver who spins generational memory into cloth.</p>
        <p>Smart contracts on the blockchain do more than timestamp and archive these artistic records. They program justice through mathematics, the only truth that cannot be manipulated, offering perpetual royalties for artists, fair collective splits, and transparent provenance. There is no centralised authority that can censor or rewrite a history recorded on the chain.</p>
        <p>The production, distribution, and consumption of art are on the verge of a seismic transformation. We are entering an era where we will finally find true freedom in why we create and who we create for.</p>
        <p><strong>Today we stand at that crossroads.</strong></p>
        <p>The Gallery of Life exists to midwife the shift—to curate the South Asian and global diaspora’s living artefacts into permanence, to empower narratives that have been hidden, to excavate and revive all that has been lost, and to tangibly prove the soul inside every medium.</p>
